# Predicting Boston Housing Prices

This is a machine learning project that predicts the price of a home based on features. 

### Install and Download

This project requires atleast Python 2.7 and the following Python libraries installed:

    Pandas
    Seaborn
    NumPy
    matplotlib
    scikit-learn

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an iPython Notebook

I highly recommend using Anaconda, a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. Jupyter is included and can run Ipython notebooks. 

 Please download the files: boston_housing.ipynb, housing.csv and visuals.py - the visuals.py file is necessary to run this project. The dataset used in this project is named "housing.csv". You can find more information on this dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository page: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php

### Run

In the Anaconda Prompt, navigate to the folder the project files have been saved in: C:\Users\User\Location\Folder (Input your information, this is just an example). Once the location has been changed, type in the Anaconda Prompt:

    jupyter notebook boston_housing.ipynb

You may need to select a browser to view the notebook in such as Internet Explorer. This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
