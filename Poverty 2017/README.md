# Poverty in The United States, 2017

This project provided storytelling and visualizations regarding poverty in The United States for year 2017 using census data. The purpose of this project is to use visualizations to convey a message to a broader range of audiences. 

### Install and Download

This project requires atleast Python 2.7 and the following Python libraries installed:

    pandas
    seaborn
	numpy
	matplotlib
	plotly
	plotly.figure_factory
	warnings
	
 Note: In order to reproduce plotly results, you may need an account at https://plot.ly/python/    
   
  
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an iPython Notebook

I highly recommend using Anaconda, a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. Jupyter is included and can run Ipython notebooks. 

 Please download these files from this repository: Poverty in The United States_2017.ipynb, Poverty States.xlsx,PovertyEstimates.xls and United States Poverty.xlsx
 The download from the census site is one file, I will disclose that I split the file into parts for ease of use. 

### Run

In the Anaconda Prompt, navigate to the folder the project files have been saved in: C:\Users\User\Location\Folder (Input your information, this is just an example). Once the location has been changed, type in the Anaconda Prompt:

    jupyter notebook Poverty in The United States_2017.ipynb

You may need to select a browser to view the notebook in such as Internet Explorer. This will open the Jupter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
