# Creating Customer Segments

This is a machine learning project that describes the variation in customer spending and provides potential insight on where to structure resources to meet the needs of the customer. 

### Install and Download

This project requires atleast Python 2.7 and the following Python libraries installed: 

    NumPy
	Pandas
	Seaborn
    matplotlib
    scikit-learn

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an iPython Notebook: https://ipython.org/notebook.html

I highly recommend using Anaconda, a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. Jupyter is included and can run Ipython notebooks.

Please download the files: customer_segments.ipynb, customers.csv 	and visuals.py - the visuals.py file is necessary to run this project. The dataset used in this project is named "customers.csv". You can find more information on this dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository page https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php


### Run

In the Anaconda Prompt, navigate to the folder the project files have been saved in: C:\Users\User\Location\Folder (Input your information, this is just an example). Once the location has been changed, type in the Anaconda Prompt:

    jupyter notebook customer_segments.ipynb

You may need to select a browser to view the notebook in such as Internet Explorer. This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
