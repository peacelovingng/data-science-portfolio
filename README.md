# Data Science Portfolio
Hello, my name is Angela and welcome to my portfolio. I am a data scientist and Biomedical Informatics PhD candidate with Rutgers University. This is a collection of projects that I am working on from a variety of disciplines and fields for academic and hobby purposes. Please visit my website at [angeladata.com](https://www.angeladata.com), if you are interested in a more aesthetically pleasing portfolio experience and to contact me.

Note: Data used in projects are for demonstration purposes and derive from publicly accessible sources. 

### Machine Learning

#### Albuquerque Crime Analysis
Supervised Learning:

#### Boston Housing Project
Supervised Learning: Predicting Boston Housing Prices: The value of a home in the Boston real estate market was predicted and identified using supervised learning and statistical analysis tools. The best price a client can sell their home was identified. This type of analysis would be useful for those that work in real estate to aid clients in finding a suitable selling price based on objective measures. 
#### Customer Segmentation 
Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments: This project analyzed customer spending using unsupervised learning techniques for further insight about customer base. This analysis would be useful in understanding the needs of customers and applying resources to meet their needs in a more prompt manner. 
#### Donors for Charity
Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for Charity: A model was designed to predict whether an individual earns more than $50,000 annually to identify potential donors for an organization. This type of analysis would be useful for non-profits or organizations that rely on donations as a source of revenue. 

### Natural Language Processing
PDF documents were parsed and certain key terms are extracted relating to health and safety. 

### Data Analysis and Visualization

#### Data Cleansing and Normalization
A mini-project completed to clean and normalize U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) data and merged with a data obtained from The Indian Health Service. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate data wrangling that is typical before analysis.
