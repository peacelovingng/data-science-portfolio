# Data Science Portfolio
Hello, my name is Angela and welcome to my portfolio. I am a data scientist and Biomedical Informatics PhD candidate with Rutgers University. This is a collection of projects that I am working on from a variety of disciplines and fields for academic and hobby purposes. Please visit my website at [angeladata.com](https://www.angeladata.com), if you are interested in an aesthetically pleasing portfolio experience.
